          <p>Outbound : From Linz</p>
          <div>
          <h3>East or South-West towards Vienna, Salzburg</h3>
          <p>One option is to go to the main train station of Linz and then walk from there to Waldeggstraße(2 minutes walk). Try to hitchhike from the bus station out of Linz onto the A7 leading out of the town, at least to the rest area Ansfelden.</p>
          <p> In order to lower the percentage of the local transport you can walk ca. 8 more minutes to the city-bus stop Kudlichstrasse. Here it is fairly easy for the drivers to stop and pick you up. This place should be fine for hitchhiking towards Prague as well.</p>
          <p>Another option is to go by tram no. 1 or 2 to the stop "Linke Brückenstraße". There walk to your right (as you exit the tram) into the Freistädter Straße. Walk for a little while and then you are on the on-ramp onto the A7 which will take you out of Linz into any direction. You can also take bus no. 33 to "Broschgasse", then you will be right next to this on-ramp. However, there is almost no space for the driver to stop on the side to pick you up therefore this place may be considered as a risky and not that well suited for hitchhiking.</p>
          <p>If you want to go to Vienna but get a ride to the rest area Ansfelden, you have to change to the other side of the A1 to get eastwards, therefore use the pedestrian tunnel under the Autobahn which can be found just before the restaurant..</p>
          <h3>North towards Czech Republic Prague, Freistadt</h3>
          <p>Appart from the possibilities mentioned in the section above, another on-ramp to A7 is on the Hafenstrasse. There is a petrol station near the crossroad and traffic lights with a good place to stop, where almost all cars pass by from the city to the motorway. Try to get a ride to Freistadt cause there you will find a perfect hitchhiking road filled with Czech cars just a few kilometres from the boarder.</p>
